            <div class="instruc">
            <h2>Instructions (How to use guide)</h2>
            <p>To begin, you will need to know the name of the media, the media type, and the format of the media. For example, if I owned a blu-ray copy of the movie Spider-Man: No Way Home, I would enter Spider-Man: No Way Home as the name of the movie, with the media type being Film and TV and Blu-ray as the media format.</p>
            <p>In the next section, Media Information, you will enter more information such as the studio that made it, the director, any actors, and other relevant information you might know and wish to add. This is your list, so you can add as many details as you want.  Using the example above, we can ignore the questions related to the Digital Library and Other answers that could have been given in the previous section, though if you owned a digital copy of the movie, you could also enter which library or store it is on and the devices you can access it from.</p>
            <p>For example, if you owned a digital copy of Spider-Man: No Way Home, you could enter Amazon Prime Video as the library/store, and PC, Xbox, and Samsung TV as devices you can access the movie from.  What is more relevant here though is the information about the movie you might want to help you sort and look for a movie later. This section asks for the Release Date, Publisher, Studio, Director, and Actors that are in the movie. For Spider-Man, you would enter December 17, 2021 as the Release Date, Sony Pictures as the Publisher/Distributor, Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios as the Studio/Developer, Jon Watts as the Director/Composer, and Tom Holland, Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch (and any others you want to include) as the Artist/Actors. </p>
            <p>The final two questions in this section are specifically related to video game media. If I were entering information about a game, I would include the platform it is playable on, and the number of players that could play the game. For example, if I was entering information about the video game, The Legend of Zelda, I could put Nintendo Entertainment System as the platform, and Single Player as the number of supported players.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Note about this Registry:</strong>
                Admittedly, entering information isn’t going to work universally for all types of media. For simplicity of the spreadsheet, some concessions had to be made. Here are some suggestions for how to list information for music, written, and video game media:</em>
            </p>
            <h3>Music:</h3>
            <p>Use Publisher/Distributor for the Music Label that released the album, Studio/Developer for where the album was recorded (if information where the album was recorded at is given), Director/Composer for the band name, primary artist, or composer, and for Artist/Actors you can list the band members individually, or by group name if that is all that’s available. For example, if I was to input information on The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King soundtrack, I would enter the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Publisher/Distributor</strong> – Reprise Records</li>
                <li><strong>Studio/Developer</strong> – (I would leave this blank as I cannot find information on where it was recorded.)</li>
                <li><strong>Director/Composer</strong> – Howard Shore</li>
                <li><strong>Artist/Actors</strong> – London Philharmonic Orchestra, London Voices, London Oratory School Schola</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Written:</h3>
            <p>For written media, you should list the books or magazines publisher as the Publisher/Distributor, if a Studio/Developer was involved, they would be listed as the Studio/Developer (Typically, this information will only be available if a group or corporation worked on a book or other written project). Director/Composer could be used for the Writer, or alternatively you could list the editor of the written media here, and Artist/Actors would be the writer, or writers depending on the written media.  As an example, if I was to enter information on the book, Freak the Mighty, I would enter the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Publisher/Distributor</strong> – Scholastic</li>
                <li><strong>Studio/Developer</strong> – (No studio is listed, so we could leave this blank, or list Blue Sky Press, which was a subsidiary of Scholastic the book as originally published under.)</li>
                <li><strong>Director/Composer</strong> – Rodman Philbrick (he’s the author, no editor is listed.) </li>
                <li><strong>Artist/Actors</strong> – (I would leave this blank since we already listed the author above.)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Video Game:</h3>
            <p>For video games, the Publisher/Distributor is the company that releases the game, the Studio/Developer is the company that makes the game, the Director is the person that is the main director/project overseer for the development of the game, and the Artist/ Actors heavily depends on the game and when it was made. Modern games are known to have regular actors or voice actors that look like the in-game character they play. Others don’t, and for older games, I would recommend using the name of the main character for the game itself. Here are two examples of games, the first is old, and the second is new.</p>
            <h4>Old Example – Mega Man 9</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Publisher/Distributor</strong> – Capcom</li>
                <li><strong>Studio/Developer</strong> – Inti Creates</li>
                <li><strong>Director/Composer</strong> – Hayato Tsuru</li>
                <li><strong>Artist/Actors</strong> – Mega Man (it’s an old school game, so I would list Mega Man as the Actor)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>New Example – Castlevania: Lords of Shadow</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Publisher/Distributor</strong> – Konami</li>
                <li><strong>Studio/Developer</strong> – Mercury Steam</li>
                <li><strong>Director/Composer</strong> –  Enric Álvarez</li>
                <li><strong>Artist/Actors</strong> – Robert Carlyle, Natascha McElhone, Patrick Stewart, Jason Isaacs</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Finishing Up</h3>
            <p>You can use the form to add as many items as you need. When you are finished adding all the items you wish to add, you will need to go to the <a id="instrcont" href="ContactUs.html">Contact Us</a> page. From there, you can enter a submission to contact our team to request a spreadsheet with the items from your media collection. All you will need to submit is the email you provided in the Media Form so that we can process your request!</p>
