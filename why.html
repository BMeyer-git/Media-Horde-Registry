            <h2>Media Horde Registry - Why?</h2>
            <h3>Where did this idea come from?</h3>
            <p>Media Horde Registry got its start many years ago, as my Dad, Ron, is an avid collector of vinyl records and movies. He has his own "man cave" dedicated to the many thousands of records, movies, and other collectables that he owns. Initially, Ron wanted to make an inventory of all the records and movies that he owned. He asked me to type out the list that he wrote up. I was hesitant to do this as I knew that this would take a very long time to type up his list. I also thought that he should include more details on each item. In the case of records, he only listed the artist and the album name. With movies, it was only the name and the format. At some point I started a list, but I didnâ€™t get very far. It was extremely time consuming, and I thought we could do better than this. </p>

            <h3>How did it develop?</h3>
            <p>During my internship, I started working with various webpages, forms and other tools. I learned of a couple of options that could help expedite this process and organize it in a simple way that either my dad or I could do. This could allow us both to work on the inventory and remove the problem where only one of us would have access to the file or program we were using at the time. After making some plans and weighing our options, I settled on making a website that could help us accomplish this and made a Google Form with an attached spreadsheet file that would save the responses. This would help us organize the items and would allow us to sort the information as well. </p>

            <p>After all this, I am proud to present this simple tool for organizing a media collection. This is the <strong>Media Horde Registry</strong>.</p>
